Rise of Nations is an incredible Real-time strategy with a powerful scripting language and an in-built IDE. I wrote a script which turns the game into a tower defense, composing and marching increasingly strong waves at the player. The script can be used in conjunction with other game mods. 

Also features greater city generation (10 farms, several houses and other economic buildings as well as some defenses). The user is limited to one city and is given gold for defeating waves - though both these realities are trivial to change in the BHS file.

Check out the .gif, a timelapse of the last hundred waves or so overunning the city.
