Simple Fraction calculator which parses input and can deal with the four basic mathematical operations ( + , - , * , / ).

The Grammar:
  Equate:
    Term
    Equate+Term
    Equate-Term
  Term:
    Fraction
    Term*Fraction
    Term/Fraction
  Fraction:
    [ADT] Fraction (int)
    [ADT] Fraction (int, int)
    
The Fraction ADT has the basic neccessary operaters overloaded, the Implementation will simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator
and denominator by the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) as ascertained by the Euclidian algorithm.

Constructors can deal with 0-2 integers, with 0 int arguments resulting in a Fraciton of value 0,
1 int arguments resulting in a Fraction where the int is the numerator and 1 is the denominator 
and 2 int arguments resulting in a Fraction where the first is the numerator and second, the denominator.
